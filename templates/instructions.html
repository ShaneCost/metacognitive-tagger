            <p>
                You will be presented with a students response to a circuit analysis
                question. Each sentence of a given response is selectable. You are to select
                each sentence of the response that suggests the student was engaging in
                active metacognition. After a sentence is selected, the sentence will be
                displayed below the overall student response along with radio button
                selection fields that pertain to the metacognitive nature of the statement.
                The first field asks you to judge whether the sentence is an example of
                “Declarative Knowledge” or “Procedural Knowledge”. Should neither apply,
                “Unknown” should be selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two additional radio flyer fields ask you to judge whether the
                statement suggests that student was expressing confidence or lack of
                confidence and the intensity of the statement (strong or mild) in terms of
                this confidence or lack of confidence. Should the statement be ambiguous
                in nature in terms of confidence or should a judgement of confidence not
                be relevant, select the “not applicable”. To reiterate, the last two fields
                pertain to the nature of the metacognitive statement and NOT to your
                personal confidence in judging the nature of the statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each selected sentence, there is an optional comment text field, should
                you wish to include any notes.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have completed tagging all the sentences that suggest active
                metacognition, select the “submit” button. As long as each radio button
                field has a selection, you will be presented with a new response to tag until
                all responses (~ 250) have been tagged. Should you not be able to complete
                tagging of the full set of responses in one sitting, simply logout and log back
                in when you are ready to resume.
